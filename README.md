# Lameazon

**It's a simple react app integrated with flask api**

---

## How it work ?

* _Searched keyword is stored to the component state then it sends post request to flask server using axios_
* _Then the flask server scraps the searched data from amazon and returns it_
* _After it prints we can add it to the cart and of course it will go away if the page reloads because i didnt want to use db for this simple app_
* _The items in the cart can be deleted if you want to_
* _I simply tried to play around with react because this is my first app_
